## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/fabric-types` - Get all fabric types
- `GET /api/colors` - Get all colors
- `GET /api/colors/{fabric_type}` - Get colors by fabric type
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `GET /api/orders/{order_id}/pdf` - Download PDF

### Admin Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/colors` - Manage colors (add/remove/update)

## Default Data Initialized

### Fabric Types
- Tela #1: Diagonal pattern
- Tela #2: Cross pattern  
- Tela #3: Cross pattern
- Tela #4: Horizontal pattern

### Default Colors
Each fabric type has 4-5 default colors including:
- Gray, Blue, Red, Black, Navy, Yellow

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Customer Information**: Fill out required customer details
2. **Area Selection**: Click on suit areas to select (single or double-click)
3. **Color Selection**: Choose from available colors for selected fabric type
4. **Preview**: See real-time color changes on suit visualization
5. **Order Creation**: Click ACCEPT to generate and download PDF
6. **Admin Management**: Use COLORES button for color management

## Button Functions

- **ACEPTAR**: Validates form, creates order, generates and downloads PDF
- **CANCELAR**: Resets all selections and form data

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for comprehensive backend testing
- Test all API endpoints
- Verify database operations
- Check PDF generation functionality

### Frontend Testing  
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- Test user interactions
- Verify color selection logic
- Check form validation
- Test PDF download functionality

### Integration Testing
- Full user workflow testing
- Admin panel functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Known Limitations
- PDF generation requires server-side processing
- Color selections are temporary until order is created
- Admin password is hardcoded (80418914)

## Environment Variables
- Backend: `MONGO_URL` for database connection
- Frontend: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` for API communication

## Success Criteria
✅ Interactive suit visualization with patterns
✅ Color selection based on fabric types  
✅ Customer form with validation
✅ PDF order generation
✅ Admin color management
✅ Help system with user guidance
✅ Responsive design
✅ Error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps for Testing
1. ✅ Run backend tests to verify all API endpoints
2. Test frontend interactions and user flows
3. ✅ Verify PDF generation with sample orders
4. ✅ Test admin panel functionality
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing
